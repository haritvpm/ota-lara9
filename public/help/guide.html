<h3>v. Notes for assistants</h3>		
<p>
<ul>

 <li>There is no need to create separate forms for different category of employees.</li>
 <li>If a new employee is not present in the list, you can add by clicking 'Employee' from the left sidemenu.</li>

 <li>
 To avoid entering the same employee names in your section again and again for duty claims throughout an assembly session, you can use  <strong>Presets</strong>.

<ul>
	<li>
		Create a new Duty Form. Select <i>any</i> session, date and OT.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Enter all the persons in your section by clicking Add Row. When finished, instead of clicking Save, click <strong>Save as Preset</strong> from the bottom right corner. Enter a name for this preset, e.g- <i>Jan2018list1</i>.
	</li>

	<li>Whenever you create a new form, just click <strong>Load Preset</strong> from bottom right corner, select a preset name and all the names of the persons in that preset will be loaded. After loading, you can delete the rows that you don't need, let's say if a person in the preset was absent on that day.</li>

	<li>Tip:- If you create a dummy first row, all the rows added by loading a preset will have the same  'time' and 'nature of work' as this first row.</li>

	<li>You can save any number of presets.</li>
